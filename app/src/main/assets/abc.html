<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #00ccff;">1.What is the blood group?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>A blood type (also called a blood group) is a classification of blood based on the presence and absence of antibodies and also based on the presence or absence of inherited antigenic substances on the surface of red blood cells (RBCs).</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #00ccff;"><strong>2.What is different types of blood?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Human blood is grouped into four types: A, B, AB, and O. Each letter refers to a kind of antigen, or protein, on the surface of red blood cells. For example, the surface of red blood cells in Type A blood has antigens known as A-antigens.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #00ccff;"><strong>3.What determines a person's blood type?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Everyone has an ABO blood type (A, B, AB, or O) and an Rh factor (positive or negative). Just like eye or hair color, our blood type is inherited from our parents. Each biological parent donates one of two ABO genes to their child. The A and B genes are dominant and the O gene is recessive.here are four major blood groups determined by the presence or absence of two antigens &ndash; A and B &ndash; on the surface of red blood cells: Group A &ndash; has only the A antigen on red cells (and B antibody in the plasma) Group B &ndash; has only the B antigen on red cells (and A antibody in the plasma)</em></p>
<p><br /><strong><span style="color: #00ccff;">4.What&rsquo;s so important about donating blood?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>A continuous supply of blood is essential to meet the needs of patients in area hospitals, and a steady stream of donors is necessary to meet that need. Blood is only available through the generosity of volunteer donors. It is estimated that 95% of the population will use blood or a blood component by the age of 75 - unfortunately, less than 5% of the eligible population actually donates.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #00ccff;"><strong>5.Who can give blood?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Almost anyone who is healthy, at least 16 years old, and weighs at least 110 pounds. (16-year-olds must weigh at least 130 lbs and need signed parental consent.) Learn more specifics at our Deferral Guidelines page.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #00ccff;">6.How much blood is drawn? Is it safe for my body to lose that much blood?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>One pint. The average person has 10-12 pints, so the small loss is easily afforded. The fluid (plasma) is replaced within 24 hours. The red cells take about five weeks. You can donate again in eight weeks!</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #00ccff;"><strong>7.Who needs blood transfusions?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Kendall Springman A wide variety of patients receive blood transfusions. The various components of donated blood are used to treat different conditions. For example, red blood cells are transfused to patients who have lost blood due to trauma or surgery, and to treat anemia (including sickle cell anemia). Cancer patients need platelet transfusions to replace the healthy cells that are destroyed during chemotherapy and radiation. Burn victims often need plasma transfusions to treat them for </em><em>shock.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #00ccff;">8.Is donating blood safe?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Absolutely. Blood donation conditions are sanitary, and needles are sterile and disposable.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #00ccff;"><strong>9.What should I do to prepare for donating?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Eat a well-balanced meal, free of fatty or fried foods. A diet that regularly includes iron-rich foods will help promote red cell regeneration, increasing your chances of having an adequate hemoglobin level for blood donation.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #00ccff;"><strong>10.How will I feel after donating? What activities can I do after my donation?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Most donors feel fine after donating. Remember to eat a healthy meal afterwards and drink plenty of fluids. You can continue your normal routine, but avoid heavy lifting and strenuous exercise for 12 hours.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #00ccff;"><strong>11.Who can receive my blood?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>A patient can receive blood that has the same ABO antigens as theirs, plus O. Rh+ can receive Rh+ or Rh-, while Rh- must receive Rh- blood.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #00ccff;">12.How do you inherit blood type?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Each biological parent donates one of their two ABO alleles to their child. A mother who is blood type O can only pass an O allele to her son or daughter. A father who </em><em>is blood type AB could pass either an A or a B allele to his son or daughter.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #00ccff;"><strong>13.What is the most common type of blood?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>There are 4 main blood groups "A", "B", "AB" and "O", of which group "O" is the most common (47% of population). The blood type is determined by proteins called antigens found on the surface of red blood cells. If you have the antigen A on the red blood cells then you have got type A blood.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #00ccff;">14.How do you test for blood type?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>The test to determine your blood group is called ABO typing. Your blood sample is mixed with antibodies against type A and B blood, and the sample is checked to see whether or not the blood cells stick together (agglutinate). If blood cells stick together, it means the blood reacted with one of the antibodies.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #00ccff;"><strong>15.Whom can i give and receive blood from?</strong></span></p>
<p><em>Your blood type is determined by the antigens it contains. There are two major types of blood antigens: ABO and Rh, which combine to create blood types: O+. O-, A+, </em><br /><em>A-, B+, B-, AB+ &amp; AB-</em></p>
<p><br /><em>If your blood type is: &nbsp; &nbsp;You can give to: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You can receive from:</em><br /><em>O Positive &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;O+, A+, B+, AB+ &nbsp; &nbsp; O+, O-</em><br /><em>A Positive &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A+, AB+ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A+, A-, O+, O-</em><br /><em>B Positive &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;B+, AB+ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;B+, B-, O+, O-</em><br /><em>AB Positive &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;AB+ Only &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All blood types</em><br /><em>O Negative &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All blood types &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;O- only</em><br /><em>A Negative &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A-, A+, AB-, AB+ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A-, O-</em><br /><em>B Negative &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;B-, B+, AB-, AB+ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;B-, O-</em><br /><em>AB Negative &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;AB-, AB+ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;AB-, A-, B-, O-</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /><span style="color: #00ccff;"><strong>16.What does it mean if your blood type is "O" positive?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>If you have blood type "O". If you fall into the "O" blood group, you have neither A nor B antigens on your red cells, but both A and B antibodies in your plasma. "O" </em><em>positive is the most common blood type; "O" negative is the universal donor type, meaning those with this blood type can donate red blood cells to anybody.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #00ccff;"><strong>17.Why is a person with type "O" blood called the universal donor?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Type "O" blood is the called the universal donor because it has neither A nor B surface antigens on the red blood cells. ... The other blood types, A, B and AB each </em><em>contain antigens on the red blood cells which would cause a reaction in someone whose blood does not have these antigens on their red blood cells. The same goes with the rh factor: if someone is negative, then they can't receive positive. "O"</em> negative<em> is the universal donor because there are absolutely no proteins&nbsp;on the RBCs, which means that anyone can receive that blood without suffering rejection.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #00ccff;"><strong>18.What is "O" negative blood type?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>As an "O" Negative blood donor you have a particularly unique opportunity to help people in emergency situations. "O" Negative blood cells are called &ldquo;universal&rdquo; meaning they can be transfused to almost any patient in need, and only 6.6% of the population has "O" Negative blood.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #00ccff;"><strong>19.Can O+ blood donate to anyone?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Blood Type O carries both antibodies, making blood type O group compatible to receive plasma from groups O, A, B and AB. However, blood type O plasma can only be given </em><em>to type O recipients. The individuals who are compatible in receiving platelets from an O+ donor are O+ recipients.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #00ccff;"><strong>20.How common is "O" negative blood?</strong></span></p>
<p><em>Approximately 95% of the INdian Population have the Rh+ Blood Types of A, B, AB or "O". Thus, resulting in a very small population of the more rare Rh Negative Blood Types. For many years Type "O" positive Blood was incorrectly considered to be the Universal Blood Donor.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #00ccff;"><strong>21.What is the rarest blood type in the India?</strong></span></p>
<p><em>The approximate distribution of blood types in the Indian population is as follows:</em></p>
<p><br /><em>population=1,236,344,631</em></p>
<p><em> O+ = 27.8% </em></p>
<p><em>A+ = 19.1% </em></p>
<p><em>B+ = 39.1% </em></p>
<p><em>AB+ = 8.4% </em></p>
<p><em>O- = 1.4% </em></p>
<p><em>A- = 0.5% </em></p>
<p><em>B- = 1.7% </em></p>
<p><em>AB- = 0.4%</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #00ccff;">22.Why can people with AB+ blood receive all types of blood?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>AB blood type are sometimes referred to as universal recipients because they can accept blood from anyone; however, because of the presence of both antigens on type AB red blood cells, people with AB blood can only donate it to others with the same type.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #00ccff;"><strong>23.What happens if you mix two different types of blood?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Your blood type is determined by the presence or absence of two antigens &ndash; A and B &ndash; on the surface of red blood cells. A third antigen, called Rh factor, will either </em><em>be present or absent. Antigens are substances that may trigger an immune response, causing your body to launch an attack if it believes they are foreign.</em></p>
